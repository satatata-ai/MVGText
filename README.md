# MVGText
MVGText code implementation

This repository contains source code for the research work described in our paper:
[MVGText: Momentum and Variance Guided Hard-Label Text Test Case Generation]()

Compared with other comparison methods, the test cases generated by MVGText exhibit the highest similarity to the original text.
## Implementation Instruction

- Run command reference MVGText.sh
- Note: The paths for some dependency files are hardcoded in the code and need to be manually changed.
